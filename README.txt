= multiset

* http://maraigue.hhiro.net/multiset/

Ruby implementation of the multiset

== DESCRIPTION:

Unlike ordinary set(see Ruby documentation for "set" library), multiset can contain two or more same items.

 Set[:a,:b,:c,:b,:b,:c] # => #<Set: {:b, :c, :a}>
 Multiset[:a,:b,:c,:b,:b,:c] # => #<Multiset:#3 :b, #2 :c, #1 :a>

Multisets are typically used for counting elements and their appearances in collections. 

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* Nothing for now

== SYNOPSIS:

 # Creating a multiset
 Set[:a,:b,:c,:b,:b,:c] # => #<Set: {:b, :c, :a}>
 Multiset[:a,:b,:c,:b,:b,:c] # => #<Multiset:#3 :b, #2 :c, #1 :a>
 
 # Counting the appearances of characters in a string
 m = Multiset.new
 "abracadabra".each_char do |c| # replace with 'each_byte' in Ruby 1.8.6 or earlier
   m << c
 end
 p m
 # => #<Multiset:#5 "a", #2 "b", #2 "r", #1 "c", #1 "d">
 
 # The same
 Multiset.new("abracadabra".split(//))
 # => #<Multiset:#5 "a", #2 "b", #2 "r", #1 "c", #1 "d">
 
 # The same, but available with Ruby 1.8.7 or later
 Multiset.new("abracadabra".each_char)
 # => #<Multiset:#5 "a", #2 "b", #2 "r", #1 "c", #1 "d">
